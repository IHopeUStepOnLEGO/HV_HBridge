# HV_HBridge

Kicad project for an high voltage h-bridge to produce an 300V AC square wave signal from given input pwm.

The used dc-dc regulator will transform a input voltage of 0 - 12V linearly up to 0-300V. 

Since the dc-dc regulator can deliver up to 1W max, the current will not exceed 3.33mA in 300V application.

This project was used to test the dielectric hold force between the plates of an variable capacitor.
